# Project: JetChain

## Team

Toufic Lawand, Shelly-Shaked Shtauber, Ricky Gunawan, & Ian Walter

## Objective

Develop a blockchain marketplace to list or request private jet flights around the world. The flights will be tokenized with the process of contracts existing on the blockchain for both requesters and jet owners. This blockchain marketplace would remove the need for flight brokers and place the onus on jet owners to ensure they are opening flights and seats for prospective buyers.

## The advantage of blockchain/smart contract platform

- Open marketplace (no need for a broker or prior relationship with charter company)
- Security
- Transparency
- Anonymity
- Scalability
- Enable efficient data collection for data analysis
