# Project: JetChain

## Team

Toufic Lawand, Shelly-Shaked Shtauber, Ricky Gunawan, & Ian Walter

## Objective

Develop a blockchain marketplace to list or request private jet flights around the world. The flights will be tokenized with the process of contracts existing on the blockchain for both requesters and jet owners. This blockchain marketplace would remove the need for flight brokers and place the onus on jet owners to ensure they are opening flights and seats for prospective buyers.

## The advantage of blockchain/smart contract platform

- Open marketplace (no need for a broker or prior relationship with charter company)
- Security
- Transparency
- Anonymity
- Scalability
- Enable efficient data collection for data analysis

## How jetChain works
jetChain acts as a marketplace, connecting private plane charters to clients by offering two options for booking flights.

Clients requesting flights from an origin to a destination at a price they set
Charters offering empty legs or flights of their own at a fixed price or through an auction

jetChain takes a small fee for each confirmed request or offer.

## Deployed contract
You can access the deployed contract on the kovan network at this address: 0x635875E4f24A3976C6F763036d25DDaA28F874aa
